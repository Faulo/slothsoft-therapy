Dear me from the past,
Happy new year, I guess. I don't really remember what you're up to, but I know you're about to start therapy at the place, and aren't really looking forward to it.
Well, good news! It's not as bad as you think. The other patients are kinda dumb, but most of them are friendly. Therapy itself is gonna be really tough, and I'm not sure it's gonna help a ton, but you'll learn a lot of stuff at least.
You're also gonna meet a really sweet and cute girl there, and while it might seem like a good idea at the time, don't get your hopes up. She's pregnant. Her boyfriend's gonna disappear soon, but well, the baby won't. She's great tho! You're gonna like her a lot.
In Claudia news, she's gonna start falling in love with that GDC dude Brenden, so brace for that. They're gonna meet again during GDC (apply there btw) and then start dating, and... I guess it's for the best. They're pretty happy together.
I wish I could tell you more, but nothing much else happened. You're finally gonna get your shit together and redecorate your place, so yay for that. That's gonna turn out well. Work (and pay) will be same old, same old. It probably would be best if you looked for a new job, but I know how it is...
Overall, I think the best news I can give you is that you're gonna live through the year, and are gonna be much happier at the end of it. I still haven't really gotten my shit together, but I feel much better about maybe getting around to doing that soon. Hooray!
Love and hugs,
 -Daniel
